Module 4B: My Data Explorer Reflection
1. Were your predictions right?
My predictions were a mixed bag. I correctly guessed that Wednesday would have the most screen time, likely due to a long day of classes and work.
However, I was wrong about my focus. I predicted Monday would be my best focus day, but the data showed my focus level was highest on Wednesday.
I was also incorrect about the effects of caffeine; I thought it helped me focus, but the analysis showed my average focus was actually higher on days with lower caffeine intake.

2. What surprised you?
Since I already track my habits fairly closely, none of the results were a major shock. The most interesting finding was the caffeine correlation.
Even though it wasn't a complete surprise, seeing the data contradict my assumption so clearly was a good reminder that feelings don't always match reality.

3. What was tricky or rewarding?
The trickiest part was definitely writing the correlateCaffeineToFocus() function.
Deciding on the threshold for "high" versus "low" caffeine (I chose 2 cups) and then figuring out the logic to calculate and compare the average focus levels for each group took some thought.
It was very rewarding to finally get it working and see a clear, data-driven conclusion, even if it wasn't what I expected.

4. How did using your own data change things?
Using my own data made the project significantly more engaging. Instead of just being an abstract coding exercise, it became a personal investigation.
The results weren't just numbers; they were insights into my own life and habits. This made the entire process, from data entry to analysis, feel more meaningful and relevant.
It's one thing to analyze a sample dataset, but it's much more impactful to analyze yourself.
