// 2. Predictions Before Coding
// Add your predictions here before you run the code.
/*
 * My Predictions:
 * - Most screen time day: Wednesday, because of a long day of classes and work.
 * - Best focus day: Monday, I usually feel ready to go at the start of the week.
 * - Does more caffeine help focus? I think so, yes. The more coffee, the more I can concentrate.
